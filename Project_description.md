# Universal and Equitable Access to Healthcare in Madagascar

## Project Initiated by:

- ANDRIAMAHATANA Tombo H.
- NOMENJANAHARY Iandrianina
- Institution: Institut National Sup√©rieur d'Informatique (INSI) from Antananarivo/Madagascar

## Context and Challenges

In Madagascar, access to healthcare is deeply unequal. Two major factors exacerbate this inequality:

Economic disparities and geographical remoteness. The wealthiest have access to the best healthcare, while those with financial difficulties cannot afford proper treatment. Furthermore, healthcare infrastructures are primarily concentrated in large cities, leaving rural and peripheral areas without immediate access to care. The absence of a public healthcare system worsens this situation, making quality care inaccessible to a large portion of the population.

## Project Objective

Our project proposes an innovative digital platform to address healthcare access inequalities by combining a solidarity-based financing model with advanced technologies. The goal is to ensure equitable access to healthcare for all Malagasy people, regardless of their financial situation or geographical location.

## Proposed Solutions

1. **Self-funding through Solidarity Contributions:**

   The project is based on a model of monthly contributions, where each platform member financially participates in solidarity. Unlike a traditional subscription, these contributions aim to support people in financial difficulty by ensuring, as much as possible, their medical coverage. All collected funds are used to finance care for the underprivileged, maintain the platform, and ensure its development.

2. **Online Consultations with AI and Doctors:**

   The platform allows patients to consult with doctors online via chat or video conference. In the absence of an available doctor, artificial intelligence provides pre-diagnoses based on symptoms described by patients. AI also assists doctors by analyzing medical records and offering recommendations based on collected data, optimizing care quality.

3. **Accessibility for Rural and Peripheral Areas:**

   To address geographical challenges, Basic Health Centers (CSBs) in rural areas will be equipped with connected infrastructures to facilitate remote consultations. Assistants in these centers will guide patients, reducing technological barriers.

4. **Long-term Vision: An Interconnected Hospital Network:**

   Beyond remote consultations, our goal is to create a national network of interconnected hospitals that will benefit from the advanced technologies integrated into the platform:

   - **Optimized Medical Data Management:** A centralized and secure system for managing patient records, facilitating access and collaboration among healthcare professionals.
   - **Predictive Diagnostics:** By analyzing historical and current data, AI will offer early diagnostics, enabling the early detection of diseases.
   - **AI-assisted Care:** Artificial intelligence will assist in analyzing medical results, such as X-rays or MRIs, to support doctors in their decisions.

   Hospitals within the network will contribute materially and financially to the platform's development, ensuring sustainable healthcare access for the population while strengthening the country's medical infrastructures.

## Technology and Data Security

The platform is built around the latest technologies in artificial intelligence and medical data management. In accordance with Malagasy Law No. 2014-038 on personal data protection, we guarantee that patients' data are stored and processed securely. Access to information is regulated by a privilege system, ensuring that only authorized professionals can access medical records.

## Impact and Prospects

Our project presents an innovative and sustainable solution to address healthcare access inequalities in Madagascar. Through a collaborative and solidarity-based platform, we integrate the latest technological advances to transform the healthcare landscape in the country. By making healthcare accessible to every Malagasy, regardless of their financial or geographical situation, and creating an interconnected hospital network, we are laying the foundations for a more just and sustainable healthcare system. Hospitals' participation in the financing and development of the project guarantees its sustainability while continuously improving the quality of care.

## Conclusion

This project aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly Goal 3: "Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages." With a solidarity-based financing model, the integration of artificial intelligence technologies, and a long-term vision of networking hospitals, we aim to revolutionize healthcare access in Madagascar, while respecting local data protection laws.
